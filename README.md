🫁 Chest X-Ray Disease Classification

A deep learning–based medical imaging system to automatically detect lung diseases from chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project aims to assist radiologists by providing fast and reliable preliminary screening for common chest conditions.

📌 Project Overview

Chest X-rays are one of the most widely used medical imaging techniques to diagnose lung diseases. However, manual diagnosis is time-consuming and requires expert radiologists. This project uses deep learning to classify X-ray images into disease categories such as:
	•	Normal
	•	Pneumonia
	•	Tuberculosis
	•	COVID-19
	•	Other lung abnormalities

The model learns visual patterns from labeled X-ray images and predicts the disease class for unseen images.

🧠 Model Architecture

The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on chest X-ray images.

Main components:
	•	Image preprocessing and normalization
	•	CNN feature extractor
	•	Fully connected classification layers
	•	Softmax output for multi-class prediction

Optionally, transfer learning models like ResNet, DenseNet, or VGG16 can be used for improved accuracy.
